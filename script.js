// display current day on top
// moment.js to recognize current time

// color-code time blocks for if they're present, future, or past
// change class attributes dependent on current time

// time blocks are text areas that can be clicked and edited
// hmm..

// when saved button is clicked, event is saved in localStorage
// saveButton.on(`click` localStorage.setItem)

// when page is refreshed events persist
// hmm..
